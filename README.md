# KotlinDiscordBot

This is a discord bot made in kotlin that I had messed around with a while ago.  I lost interest in the project and haven't worked on it in nine months.  I figured I would make it public since there is nothing sensitive about it, and since there is no work being done.

## About

The Discord API Library is JDA that was adapted to be used in Kotlin.

As far as I know the only supported way to work with Kotlin is through [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

You should be able to open this project right in IDEA, good luck all.
